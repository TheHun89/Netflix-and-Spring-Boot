## Hystrix - fault tolerance

* **DEPRECATION WARNING**: Spring Cloud Hystrix project is deprecated. Resilience4j is the new alternative. Resilience4j comes with other features like Rate Limiter, Retry and Bulkhead along with Circuit Breaker pattern.

### Setup
Hystrix improves fault tolerance; especially useful when many microservices talk to each other and one goes down.

### Execution
